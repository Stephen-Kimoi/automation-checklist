------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/muslimalfatih/collective-impact
Total Score: 2/8
README Documentation: 2/5
Commit Activity: 0/3

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README file is missing a general project description, integration instructions (if applicable), and contribution guidelines. The setup instruction is provided, but it's a single command without any context or explanation. The overall clarity and structure of the README file are also lacking, making it difficult to understand the project's purpose and how to get started. Additionally, the grammar and formatting could be improved to make the documentation more readable.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  No commits found during hackathon period.. No weekly development activity to summarize.

------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/LintDAO/pricelint
Total Score: 6/8
README Documentation: 3/5
Commit Activity: 3/3

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The documentation appears to be good, but it could be more detailed and structured. The project description is clear, and the features and technical architecture are well-explained. However, I couldn't find any setup instructions for local development, which would be essential for developers to contribute to the project. Additionally, although there is a mention of the frontend and backend technologies, there is no clear integration guide on how to integrate the frontend and backend components.
