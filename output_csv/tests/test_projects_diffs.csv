LintDAO/pricelint,https://github.com/LintDAO/pricelint,3,0,3,"The README file provides a good general overview of the project, including its purpose, key features, and technical architecture. However, it lacks setup instructions for local development, which is an important aspect of technical documentation. Additionally, the integration guide is not included, which might be necessary for developers who want to integrate PriceLint with their existing systems. The contribution guidelines are also missing, which could be helpful for potential contributors.",No commits found during hackathon period.. No weekly development activity to summarize.
