Total Score: 0/8

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README file provides a good overview of the project, its features, and its technical architecture. However, it lacks some essential elements that would make it a comprehensive documentation. Specifically, there is no setup instructions for local development, which is crucial for developers who want to contribute to the project. Additionally, there is no integration guide for integrating PriceLint with other systems or services.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  No commits found during hackathon period.. No weekly development activity to summarize.
