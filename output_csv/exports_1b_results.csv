The only commit that seems to indicate actual project development is ""Added SecureEye Rust backend"", which suggests that the team made some meaningful progress during the hackathon. The lack of consistency in commit messages and the presence of minor changes (e.g., ""Add files via upload"") prevent me from giving a higher score. Overall, the commit activity is fair, but could be more substantial to demonstrate excellent development activity."
