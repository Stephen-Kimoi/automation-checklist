However, the installation instructions could be more detailed and step-by-step. | README Quality: The README file is well-structured and provides a good overview of the project. The use of headers and formatting is effective in breaking up the content and making it easy to read. The explanations are clear and concise, especially for those familiar with the Internet Computer development community. | Commit Activity: The project has a total of 8 commits during the hackathon period, which is a good sign of active development. The commit messages are also of good quality, indicating that the developers are taking the time to clearly document their changes. However, the lack of consistency in commit frequency and the presence of a ""Backup commit before author rewrite"" suggest that the development activity was not as steady as it could have been. Nevertheless, the commits do show actual project development, with updates to the backend, frontend, and UI design. Overall, the project's commit activity is good, but could be improved by maintaining a more consistent pace throughout the hackathon."
sarthakbahal/supply-chain,https://github.com/sarthakbahal/supply-chain,3,3,3,9,"README Installation: The README file provides a good foundation for installation instructions, but could be more detailed. The file starts by listing the dependencies required for the project, which is a great start. However, the installation steps themselves are somewhat vague and could benefit from more guidance. For example, the file mentions ""setting up the environment"" but doesn't provide specific instructions on how to do so. Additionally, there is no clear mention of any prerequisites or compatibility issues that the user may encounter. While the file is easy to follow overall, it could benefit from more concrete steps and details to ensure a successful installation. | README Quality: The README file is generally understandable, but it could benefit from better organization and formatting. The content is presented in a block of text without clear headings or sections, making it difficult to follow at times. The language is simple and concise, but there are a few grammatical errors and minor spelling mistakes (e.g., ""Task"" is not capitalized). The explanations are clear, but could be more detailed, especially for complex concepts. | Commit Activity: The project has a total of 2 commits during the hackathon period, which is a relatively low number. However, the commit messages suggest that the commits are meaningful and show actual project development. The commit messages ""almost done"" and ""icp init"" indicate that the developer has made significant progress during the hackathon period. The consistency of development activity is not high, as there are only 2 commits, but the quality of the commits is good. Overall, the commit activity is fair, but could be more active to demonstrate a more consistent development pace."
