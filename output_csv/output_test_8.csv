muslimalfatih/collective-impact,https://github.com/muslimalfatih/collective-impact,3,3,1,7,"The README provides some basic information about the project, its features, and its technical stack. However, it lacks clear step-by-step installation instructions. The ""Development Setup"" section is incomplete, and the instructions are not easy to follow. The prerequisites are mentioned, but the installation process is not detailed enough to get a project up and running.","The README file is generally well-organized, and the content is easy to follow. The use of headers and formatting is good, making it easy to navigate and understand the structure of the project. The descriptions of the problem, solution, and tech stack are clear and concise.",No commits found during hackathon period.

LintDAO/pricelint,https://github.com/LintDAO/pricelint,4,4,1,9,"The README provides a clear introduction to the project and its components, which is a good start. However, the installation steps are somewhat basic and could be more detailed. The instructions for running the project locally are provided, but they assume a certain level of familiarity with the dfx tool and the project's structure. Additionally, there is no mention of any prerequisites, such as a specific version of Node.js or a particular environment. While the instructions are generally easy to follow, a more comprehensive and step-by-step guide would be beneficial for new users. Overall, the README provides a good foundation, but could be improved with more detailed installation steps and additional context.","The README file is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear headings and a logical flow. The language is generally professional, and the use of formatting (e.g., bold text, emojis) adds a touch of personality to the document. However, there are some minor issues that prevent it from being a perfect 5.",No commits found during hackathon period.

The content focuses on the project's features, technical stack, and overview, but does not provide any guidance on how to actually install and set up the project.","The README file is generally well-structured and easy to follow. The use of headers and formatting is effective in breaking up the content into clear sections. The language is technical, but the explanations are clear and concise. However, there are a few areas where the writing could be improved:",No commits found during hackathon period.
