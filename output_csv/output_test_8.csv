muslimalfatih/collective-impact,https://github.com/muslimalfatih/collective-impact,3,4,1,8,"The README provides a good overview of the project, its features, and its technology stack. However, it lacks clear step-by-step installation instructions. The ""Development Setup"" section provides some guidance on installing dependencies and setting up the local environment, but it's not a comprehensive guide. The reader needs to have some prior knowledge of the Internet Computer Protocol and its tools to follow the instructions. Additionally, the steps are not explicitly numbered or formatted in a clear and concise manner. To improve the score, the author could provide a more detailed and step-by-step guide on how to install and set up the project, including any specific commands or configurations required.","The README file is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear headings and a logical flow of information. The project's vision, mission, and goals are clearly explained, and the technical details are provided in a concise and organized manner. The use of headers, formatting, and code snippets is effective in breaking up the content and making it more readable.",No commits found during hackathon period.

LintDAO/pricelint,https://github.com/LintDAO/pricelint,3,4,1,8,"The README provides some basic installation instructions, including commands to start the replica, deploy canisters, and start the frontend. However, the instructions are somewhat concise and don't provide a clear step-by-step guide on how to install the project. For example, it's not clear what dependencies are required to run the project, or what specific packages need to be installed. Additionally, the instructions assume that the reader is already familiar with the dfx tool and its commands. While the basics are present, a more detailed installation guide would improve the clarity and usability of the README.","The README file is generally well-structured and clear, with a good use of headers and formatting. The language is professional, and the concepts are explained in a way that is easy to understand. However, there are a few areas where improvement is needed:",No commits found during hackathon period.
franRappazzini/PayPeer,https://github.com/franRappazzini/PayPeer,2,4,1,7,"The README file provides a detailed overview of the PayPeer project, its features, and its technical architecture. However, it does not include any installation steps or instructions on how to set up the project. The file focuses more on the project's design and concepts rather than providing practical guidance on installing and running the project. To improve, the README file should include clear installation steps and dependencies listed, making it easier for users to get started with the project.","The README file is generally well-structured and clear, with a good use of headers and formatting. The content is organized into logical sections, making it easy to follow and understand. The writing is professional, and the use of technical terms is appropriate.",No commits found during hackathon period.
