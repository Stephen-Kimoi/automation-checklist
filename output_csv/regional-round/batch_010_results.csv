Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week we delivered a mobile‑first overhaul across the app, adding a hamburger navigation overlay, integrated header, responsive My Garden redesign with a full‑staking amount modal, unified deposit interface, expandable asset cards, a balance‑aware asset dropdown, and a collapsible portfolio overview with conditional status‑bar displays. We also standardized token naming and UI styling, refactored legacy IIFE patterns into reusable functions, removed console logs, and migrated inline styles to Tailwind‑based CSS, improving code maintainability and visual consistency. Together, these changes dramatically boost mobile usability, streamline asset handling, and reduce technical debt while preserving existing functionality.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we delivered a professional order‑book UI (LimitOrderInput, OpenOrdersList), a full‑screen Transaction Preview modal, an execution‑progress modal with real‑time address validation and gas‑optimization UI, and a new CompactDEXSelector + DEXIcon component that powers a weighted, multi‑agent DEX routing system (ICDEX, ICPSwap, KongSwap) with Plug‑wallet support. We also removed all Solana‑related code, assets, and routing logic, consolidating the platform to a Bitcoin + Ethereum‑only six‑agent architecture, simplified the asset UI, and fixed over 100 TypeScript errors in Dashboard.tsx while improving CI and test coverage. Together these changes streamline the swap flow, boost routing efficiency and user experience on desktop and mobile, and provide a more stable, maintainable foundation aligned with the DFINITY roadmap.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week we completed the mainnet launch of the HodlHut dApp, deploying both frontend and Motoko backend canisters with .did interfaces, adding the Smart Solutions system with CompactDEX integration, a persistent actor, LightningCSS‑enhanced Tailwind builds, and full demo‑mode portfolio handling with real‑time market data and order‑book slippage modeling for ICDEX, ICPSwap, and KongSwap. We refined the UI by introducing a native‑withdrawal Execute button, gas‑optimization controls, zero‑balance warnings, fee‑deduction logic, and high‑slippage alerts, while fixing critical swap‑route bugs, compilation errors, and L1‑withdrawal accounting.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: A complete Vite‑based frontend was introduced, adding a login page, a new wallet page with supporting components (BalanceCard, PromoCard, TokenList, Sidebar, TopBar) and a suite of reusable UI primitives, plus background DotGrid animations and updated routing. Existing App.tsx was refactored to simplify the layout and integrate the new routes, while the dfx.json and .gitignore were extended to handle the new frontend assets and build outputs. These changes bring a functional user interface and wallet functionality that were absent in the initial state.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented a hot‑fix for the DotGrid component by fixing the device‑pixel‑ratio calculation (setting `dpr` to 1) to correct rendering issues. Added the `ogl` library (v1.0.11) to both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, introducing a new 3D graphics dependency. These changes improve visual fidelity and expand the project’s capability for future graphics features.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week a full new frontend scaffold was added under a lowercase `frontend/` directory, bringing in Vite, Tailwind, package configs, a comprehensive UI component library, and new pages such as Login, Wallet, Transfer, and supporting utilities. The repository’s `.gitignore` was expanded to cover Vite build artifacts and frontend‑specific files, and a hot‑fix added environment variable definitions to the Vite config.
