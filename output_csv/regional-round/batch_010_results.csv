Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week we delivered a mobile‑first redesign across the app, adding a hamburger navigation overlay, integrated header, larger touch targets and accessibility labels, plus a new progressive‑disclosure staking experience in My Garden with an amount‑selection modal, expandable asset‑detail cards, real‑time balance/US$ values and a collapsible portfolio overview. We also enhanced the swap flow with an auto‑populated “From” asset dropdown, smart portfolio‑based filtering, persistent state, and refined UI elements (Tailwind v4 styling, updated icons, cursor fixes) while refactoring console statements, IIFEs and inline styles into reusable functions and Tailwind‑based CSS. These updates standardize token naming, eliminate technical debt, and dramatically improve mobile usability, consistency, and user confidence in staking and swapping features.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we delivered a full professional order‑book UI (LimitOrderInput, OpenOrdersList, error handling, toast notifications, environment‑aware result indicators) with comprehensive Jest tests, polyfills and CI improvements, and introduced a new mobile‑first TransactionPreviewModal and compact DEX selector UI styled with Tailwind v4. We expanded the DEX integration layer by adding three adapters (ICDEX, ICPSwap, KongSwap) plus a weighted‑scoring DEXRoutingAgent, Plug‑wallet hooks, address validation, gas‑optimisation UI, and deployment‑ready canisters (HutFactory, MyHut), enabling real‑time quote fetching and large‑order support. Finally, we removed all Solana‑related code, consolidating the platform to a Bitcoin‑and‑Ethereum‑only six‑agent architecture, fixed critical TypeScript errors in Dashboard.tsx, and achieved a cleaner, more maintainable codebase aligned with DFINITY’s roadmap.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week we completed the mainnet launch of HodlHut, deploying both frontend and Motoko backend canisters (with .did interfaces) and adding the Smart Solutions system integrated with CompactDEX, while also fixing critical USDT swap‑route bugs and polishing the UI with a native‑withdrawal button. We introduced a robust demo‑mode portfolio featuring live balance updates, fee deduction, status‑bar tracking, zero‑balance warnings with correct Tailwind colors, and accurate L1‑withdrawal accounting, and we integrated ICPSwap, KongSwap, and ICDEX order‑book data using a unified slippage‑calculation model and dynamic UI alerts.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: A full React frontend was added (lower‑case frontend/), including a Vite setup, Tailwind config, and a large UI component library, plus new pages for Index, Login, NotFound, and a complete Wallet UI (BalanceCard, PromoCard, TokenList, Sidebar, TopBar). The existing App routing was updated to expose “/login” and “/wallet” routes, the login page now features a DotGrid animated background and a button that navigates to the wallet page, and the DotGrid background was removed from the main App layout. .gitignore and dfx.json were expanded to handle the new frontend assets and declarations, integrating the new UI into the overall project.; Week of 2025-09-15: The DotGrid component’s canvas scaling bug was fixed by forcing a device‑pixel‑ratio of 1, improving visual consistency. The OGL graphics library was added to the frontend dependencies (package.json and lockfile) to enable future WebGL rendering features. Together, these updates refine rendering behavior and expand the project’s graphical capabilities.; Week of 2025-09-22: A full new frontend project was added, bringing dozens of React/TypeScript pages (Login, Wallet, Transfer, etc.), a comprehensive UI component library (accordions, dialogs, charts, menus, token list, hyperspeed effects, etc.), and all related configuration files (vite, tailwind, tsconfig, package.json).

We also overhauled the UI—simplifying theme configuration, typography, spacing, and responsive layouts while enhancing animations for the meeting scheduler, AIConversationStep, CryptoAgreementStep, and a new jellyfish‑eye effect—and fixed loading and 404 handling on the file‑content page with added null checks. Together, these changes boost visual consistency, performance, stability, and search visibility across the application.; Week of 2025-09-08: We added SEO enhancements (structured‑data job‑posting and FAQ schemas plus an ICP‑jobs‑focused landing‑page title), a dynamic credit‑calculation UI, a CallToActionStep component with job‑seeker/employer cards, an extensible LoginButton, the ask_ai utility for centralized Groq AI requests, and refreshed branding assets with a makefile‑driven generation command.  

We migrated the AI backend from Anthropic to Groq Llama models, introduced retrieval‑augmented generation for the chatbot (semantic search of white‑paper and job‑matching docs), aligned credit handling across frontend and backend, and updated the job‑matching service to use the new utility.  

These changes improve search discoverability, provide accurate usage billing, enrich AI interactions, streamline authentication and UI flows, and leave the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week the team rolled out major UI/UX upgrades, adding context‑aware chatbot features (isLatestMessage control, auto‑complete typing animations, richer bubble handling and user‑type‑based welcome messages) and a redesigned job‑search experience with quality indicators, empty states, and improved match‑card interactions. New functionality was introduced, including USDC conversion in the wallet, SEO/FAQ pages, affiliate‑ID support in registration, and a unified Google Calendar component with timezone handling, while theme components were refined for light/dark modes and chip variants.
