However, it lacks essential practical information. There are no step‑by‑step setup instructions for local development (e.g., cloning the repo, installing dependencies, building, running the canisters, or configuring Internet Identity). Integration guidance is limited to a few external links and a brief mention of canister URLs, without clear instructions on how a developer would incorporate the service into their own app. There is no contribution guide, code of conduct, or information on how to submit issues or pull requests.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week we added a user‑scoped listPublicNotesByUser API, a robust passkey registration flow with Appwrite integration, a global NotesContext and ContextMenuProvider for unified fuzzy search and note‑card menus, and upgraded the app to Next.js 15.4.7. We also tightened shared‑note handling, fixed middleware rewrites, memoized AI, prompt and Fuse.js handlers, corrected type‑safety and permission utilities, and applied security hardening and build‑pipeline adjustments. Together these changes improve security, performance, and reliability while delivering a smoother, more consistent UI experience.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we added modular components (collaborators, hashed API‑keys, core client with usage‑metrics and plan‑limit enforcement), full revision tracking for notes, a comprehensive tag‑system overhaul, and a versioned AI generation endpoint with provider health monitoring and hashed‑key security. We also refreshed the sharing UI with debounced searches, optimistic updates, and permission management, introduced incremental note loading with cursor‑based pagination, built a global keyboard‑shortcuts system, and created an account‑deletion “danger zone” plus passkey flow refinements. Collectively, these changes boost modularity, data integrity, security, observability, and overall user experience across notes, tags, AI, and collaboration features.; Week of 2025-09-22: Added documentation of the newly created encrypted_notes and internet‑identity canisters (including their IDs) to the README, and extended the sample environment file with corresponding URL variables for these canisters, enabling proper configuration and integration.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-15: This week the frontend was overhauled: React Router routing and new Overview, Strategy, and Dashboard pages with shared layout and navigation were added, and wallet integration was enhanced with connection prompts, external modal control, and improved state handling. The custom strategy builder and strategy cards were simplified by removing allocation logic and UI, and the mock strategy data was updated to reflect single‑protocol strategies. Additional work introduced a Playwright testing pipeline, UI refinements (modal portal, grid stretch) and .gitignore updates for Claude and Playwright files.; Week of 2025-09-22: Added Compound V3 as a new lending protocol and updated the OG Duo strategy to combine AAVE V3 and Compound V3, extending mock protocol/strategy data and persisting strategies in the store. Overhauled activity tracking with a new ActivityTimeline component, AI‑driven rebalance transaction types, expanded transaction type definitions, and added store methods for aggregating activity, generating default activity, and handling AI decisions.

These changes streamline the location‑selection workflow, improve UI guidance, and enhance overall stability.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week we delivered a new frontend wallet UI with accompanying wallet and commission canister services, integrated them into the booking workflow, added a payment.prompt feature, and removed legacy remittance logic from both backend and frontend. We also set up Firebase configuration, Docker containers for streamlined local development, introduced a new account‑creation and greeting flow (IPR‑65), and fixed a bug in the Add component. A broad refactor cleaned out unused code and comments and the changelog was updated, enhancing overall maintainability and clarity.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented OTP verification, a new notification canister, multiple‑package support, payment‑holding/release with dynamic commission, unique package‑name validation, wallet‑canister top‑up, mock GCash and Firestore emulator for testing, and expanded direct‑payment limits to 2.5 units with automatic +63 phone‑code prepending. Existing flows were refined—including notification UI, cancel‑confirmation buttons, provider‑booking cards, wallet UI commission notices, transaction‑log and balance fixes—and cross‑platform (Linux) compatibility and code‑style formatting were applied.
