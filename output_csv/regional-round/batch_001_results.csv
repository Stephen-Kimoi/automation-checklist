Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: Implemented user‑scoped public notes, a TypeScript‑based passkey registration API, a client‑side fuzzy search powered by Fuse.js with a new global NotesContext, and a centralized ContextMenuProvider that standardises note‑card menus; additional updates include a renamed TagManager onChange prop, stricter TypeScript typings, and corrected permission re‑exports for reliable note sharing. Performance and build stability were boosted by upgrading to Next 15.4.7, disabling ESLint during compilation, memoising search hooks, AI/prompt handlers, and data‑fetching callbacks, and fixing middleware redirects and UI import issues. Together these changes tighten security, improve responsiveness, and raise overall code quality and developer experience.; Week of 2025-09-15: Added a suite of new backend capabilities—including collaborators and hashed API‑key modules, subscription plan enforcement, full revision and diff tracking for notes, a versioned AI‑generation endpoint with provider‑agnostic routing, and a complete account‑deletion and passkey‑auth flow—alongside extensive schema updates, tag‑management deduplication/hydration, and a robust cursor‑based pagination system with configurable page sizes. Existing features were refined with sharing‑UI enhancements, optimistic updates, AI‑button health checks, global keyboard shortcuts, and idempotent guards that prevent duplicate entries, plus performance‑focused changes such as reduced userId size and dual‑write synchronization. Together these changes improve data integrity, security, auditability, and overall user experience while laying the groundwork for future AI‑driven note functionality.; Week of 2025-09-22: Added documentation of the newly created encrypted_notes and internet-identity canisters to the README and introduced corresponding environment variables in .sample.env for their local URLs, enabling the project to reference these blockchain components.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-15: This week the front‑end was overhauled: React Router was added with new Overview, Strategy and Dashboard pages plus a navigation layout, a Playwright development pipeline was introduced and several dependencies were updated. The custom strategy builder and strategy cards were simplified by removing allocation logic, mock strategy data was adjusted accordingly, and the strategy selector now includes wallet‑connection prompts, tab handling and a cleaner UI. Additionally, modal rendering was made portal‑based, wallet‑integration handling was improved, and the .gitignore was expanded to exclude Claude and Playwright files.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week the frontend was expanded with a new Compound V3 lending protocol and an “OG Duo” strategy that combines AAVE V3 and Compound V3 for diversified low‑risk yields. Transaction handling was upgraded to include AI‑driven rebalance details, new activity types, default activity generation, and related store methods, while the dashboard UI (ActivePositions, ActivityTimeline, PositionManagementModal) received risk‑based icons, tabs, quick‑action buttons, and improved toast notifications.
