However, it lacks essential documentation elements:","1 - commits for only one week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-15: This week a toast‑based snackbar was added to confirm URL copies, and the Custom Domain modal was substantially refactored – introducing a tabbed “configure/register” UI, richer iconography, improved domain validation, and streamlined registration/verification flows. Minor UI tweaks were also applied to the canister list, deployment modal, and related imports for consistency. Overall the changes enhance user feedback, domain management, and polish the panel’s interface.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week the Custom Domain modal was enhanced with proper domain parsing using the new **psl** library, generating and displaying the correct DNS record names (apex vs. sub‑domain) and adding a reusable **CopyButton** component for easy copying. UI tweaks were applied to the Canister page (button formatting, interactive preview toggle) and the TypeScript config was relaxed slightly, while dependencies were updated (psl, @radix-ui/react-tooltip, @supabase). Overall, the changes improve custom domain setup guidance and polish the panel’s user experience.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: We restructured the frontend build pipeline by consolidating to a single root tsconfig and Vite‑specific config, migrating to ESLint v9 flat config (adding the missing parser, fixing JSX handling, and excluding problematic declaration files), and adding new npm scripts along with upgraded TypeScript/Vite settings (ES2022 target, path aliases) to eliminate linting and type errors and streamline development. A comprehensive theming system was introduced—including a CSS‑variable palette, dark‑mode support, Tailwind/shadcn‑ui integration, accordion animation utilities, and a full Tailwind pipeline with PostCSS, Autoprefixer, global variables, and typography—while duplicate files were removed and core entity type definitions were added. New UI features such as a ProfilePage component and placeholder canister client definitions for future ICP integration were built, documentation was refreshed, and overall code quality, developer productivity, and readiness for upcoming backend features were significantly improved.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure
