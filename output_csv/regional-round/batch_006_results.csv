It also links to external documentation for broader context. However, the file lacks a clear, concise project description that explains what the `smart_ac` project does or its purpose. There are no integration or usage examples beyond the raw commands, and there are no contribution guidelines (e.g., how to submit issues or pull requests, coding standards, testing procedures). The opening sentence appears truncated, and there are minor formatting/grammar issues (e.g., missing space in “set`DFX_NETWORK`”). Overall, the documentation covers the essential setup steps but omits several key elements expected for a complete README, placing it at a “fair” level.","1 - commits for only one week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-22: Added a new Motoko‑based backend for the Automated AC project, including `src/smart_ac_backend/main.mo`, `dfx.json`, `memory.json`, and a fresh `smart_ac_backend_project/README.md`, while deleting the previous README.

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week the backend API was expanded with new queries `get_final_result` and `list_user_final_results` to retrieve a user’s final transcription/summarization results. The upload module was refactored: the transcription‑related helper functions were moved into a new `upload::service` package (adding `call_ollama`, `call_transcription` and `fetch_transcription`), and the previous in‑module HTTP‑request logic was removed in favor of this service layer. Minor frontend tweaks (a debug log and a typo fix) and a small environment‑variable change were also applied.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we enhanced the upload system with in‑memory chunked retrieval and introduced a new file‑artifact type that automatically generates titles and stores bookmark metadata, while adding searchable, filterable artifact pages with bookmarking and segmented transcription support, plus frontend components for lazy‑loading pages, empty‑state messaging, bookmark toggling, and seekable transcription results. New UI components were added for exploring content, managing “My Work,” and viewing saved‑work lists, the unused use‑debounce package was removed, and a backend error was fixed along with a refactor of the save‑final‑result logic for greater reliability.
