PROJECT 1: Buildathonzx/whisperrnote
------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/Buildathonzx/whisperrnote
Total Score: 4/9
README Documentation: 2/5
Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 0/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a visually appealing overview and a solid high‑level description of the project’s purpose, AI features, and blockchain integration. However, it lacks essential practical information. There are no step‑by‑step setup instructions for local development (e.g., cloning the repo, installing dependencies, building, running the canisters, or configuring Internet Identity). Integration guidance is limited to a few external links and a brief mention of canister URLs, without clear instructions on how a developer would incorporate the service into their own app. There is no contribution guide, code of conduct, or information on how to submit issues or pull requests. While the formatting and grammar are generally good, the missing core documentation elements (setup, contribution, detailed usage) keep the overall quality at a poor level.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week we added a user‑scoped listPublicNotesByUser API, a robust passkey registration flow with Appwrite integration, a global NotesContext and ContextMenuProvider for unified fuzzy search and note‑card menus, and upgraded the app to Next.js 15.4.7. We also tightened shared‑note handling, fixed middleware rewrites, memoized AI, prompt and Fuse.js handlers, corrected type‑safety and permission utilities, and applied security hardening and build‑pipeline adjustments. Together these changes improve security, performance, and reliability while delivering a smoother, more consistent UI experience.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we added modular components (collaborators, hashed API‑keys, core client with usage‑metrics and plan‑limit enforcement), full revision tracking for notes, a comprehensive tag‑system overhaul, and a versioned AI generation endpoint with provider health monitoring and hashed‑key security. We also refreshed the sharing UI with debounced searches, optimistic updates, and permission management, introduced incremental note loading with cursor‑based pagination, built a global keyboard‑shortcuts system, and created an account‑deletion “danger zone” plus passkey flow refinements. Collectively, these changes boost modularity, data integrity, security, observability, and overall user experience across notes, tags, AI, and collaboration features.; Week of 2025-09-22: Added documentation of the newly created encrypted_notes and internet‑identity canisters (including their IDs) to the README, and extended the sample environment file with corresponding URL variables for these canisters, enabling proper configuration and integration. This improves setup clarity and readiness for blockchain‑backed features. Minor updates and fixes.

GitHub Link: https://github.com/YieldexAI/yieldex-ic-wallet-manager
Total Score: 5/9
README Documentation: 2/5
Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The excerpt provides detailed, well‑formatted command examples for interacting with the canister’s API (wallet generation, balance queries, AAVE/Compound integration, and token rebalancing). The usage sections are clear, include emojis, code blocks, and even sample output, which is helpful for end‑users.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-15: This week the frontend was overhauled: React Router routing and new Overview, Strategy, and Dashboard pages with shared layout and navigation were added, and wallet integration was enhanced with connection prompts, external modal control, and improved state handling. The custom strategy builder and strategy cards were simplified by removing allocation logic and UI, and the mock strategy data was updated to reflect single‑protocol strategies. Additional work introduced a Playwright testing pipeline, UI refinements (modal portal, grid stretch) and .gitignore updates for Claude and Playwright files.; Week of 2025-09-22: Added Compound V3 as a new lending protocol and updated the OG Duo strategy to combine AAVE V3 and Compound V3, extending mock protocol/strategy data and persisting strategies in the store. Overhauled activity tracking with a new ActivityTimeline component, AI‑driven rebalance transaction types, expanded transaction type definitions, and added store methods for aggregating activity, generating default activity, and handling AI decisions. Refined the UI with risk‑based icons/color in ActivePositions, new QuickActionButtons and Badge components, a tabbed PositionManagementModal, and improved toast handling, all integrated with the updated stores.

PROJECT 3: alfa-codes/alfa-apy-icp-canisters
------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/alfa-codes/alfa-apy-icp-canisters
Total Score: 4/9
README Documentation: 1/5
Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The provided README excerpt contains only a handful of external links (repository URLs, website, and community resources) and lacks any substantive content. There is no general project description, no setup or installation instructions for local development, no integration or usage guide, and no contribution guidelines. The structure is minimal, and there is insufficient information to assess the project or to help a new developer get started. Consequently, the documentation quality is very poor.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week we added a new `get_pools_history` endpoint for pool statistics, introduced project branding assets (logo) and a LICENSE file, and merged recent updates into the main branch. We also enhanced deployment configuration by adding controller settings for canisters, updating the production environment URL, and fixing chart snapshot generation bugs. Together, these changes expand API functionality, improve deployment reliability, and polish the project's visual and legal presentation.; Week of 2025-09-08: Implemented ICRC‑21 support in the vault canister by adding the necessary ledger‑type imports, registering ICRC‑21 in the supported standards list, and introducing a new query (`icrc21_canister_call_consent_message`) to handle consent‑message requests. This enhances the vault’s compliance with the ICRC‑21 authentication standard, enabling it to provide consent information for canister calls. No new files were added; only `src/vault/src/lib.rs` was modified.

Commit Activity: 3/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a high‑level overview of the platform’s features and a detailed architecture diagram, which is helpful for understanding the system’s components. However, it lacks several critical sections required for a comprehensive README:

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  3 - Commits every week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: We introduced a manual location input mode and refactored the service‑location inputs, enabling users to select province and city with dynamically populated barangay dropdowns. The booking component’s location label was clarified, a page‑reload bug was fixed, and minor configuration and package.json clean‑ups were applied. These changes streamline the location‑selection workflow, improve UI guidance, and enhance overall stability.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week we delivered a new frontend wallet UI with accompanying wallet and commission canister services, integrated them into the booking workflow, added a payment.prompt feature, and removed legacy remittance logic from both backend and frontend. We also set up Firebase configuration, Docker containers for streamlined local development, introduced a new account‑creation and greeting flow (IPR‑65), and fixed a bug in the Add component. A broad refactor cleaned out unused code and comments and the changelog was updated, enhancing overall maintainability and clarity.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented OTP verification, a new notification canister, multiple‑package support, payment‑holding/release with dynamic commission, unique package‑name validation, wallet‑canister top‑up, mock GCash and Firestore emulator for testing, and expanded direct‑payment limits to 2.5 units with automatic +63 phone‑code prepending. Existing flows were refined—including notification UI, cancel‑confirmation buttons, provider‑booking cards, wallet UI commission notices, transaction‑log and balance fixes—and cross‑platform (Linux) compatibility and code‑style formatting were applied. Together these updates enhance core user experiences, financial reliability, and overall system stability while providing a more robust development and testing environment.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week we refined the UI by running Prettier across the codebase, improving overall formatting consistency. We also resolved several minor bugs affecting notifications, alerts, and the service‑details page, resulting in smoother interactions and more reliable data display. No new features were added, but the stability and visual polish of existing components were noticeably enhanced.

  The README provides a solid project overview, clearly listing key features, architectural components, and a roadmap. It includes thorough local development setup instructions—prerequisites, cloning, dependency installation, canister deployment, and how to run the app—making it easy for a new developer to get started. The structure is well‑organized with headings, bullet points, and code blocks, and the grammar/formatting are clean.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: Updated the authentication flow to use the new Internet Identity provider (`https://id.ai`) instead of the previous `https://identity.ic0.app`, modifying the URLs in both `AuthContext.tsx` and `useAuth.ts`. This change improves the app’s login integration without adding or removing any files. Overall, it’s a targeted enhancement to the existing auth feature.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented a new ICRC‑1 token infrastructure by adding ledger and index canisters, registering them in dfx.json, and recording their IDs in canister_ids.json. Added the required candid interfaces, compiled wasm artifacts, and a token icon asset under src/token and the frontend assets. This introduces native token support and the associated front‑end resources to the project.

PROJECT 10: LotusWallet/LOTS
------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/LotusWallet/LOTS
Total Score: 5/9
README Documentation: 3/5
Commit Activity: 1/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a solid overview of the project’s purpose, features, API, security model, and a clear project structure. It includes a brief contribution guide (fork, branch, PR) and lists roadmap items, licensing, and support channels. However, it lacks explicit setup instructions for local development (e.g., prerequisites, how to install dependencies, build commands, and how to run the backend/frontend). There is no integration guide for consumers of the library or API usage beyond the method table. While the sections are well‑structured and the formatting is readable, the missing setup and integration details prevent it from reaching a higher rating. Overall, the documentation is functional but incomplete, meriting a “Fair” rating.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-22: Implemented a standalone password generator (PasswordGenerator and PasswordGeneratorModal) integrated into the dashboard and entry dialogs, and added new field types (url, email, date) across the backend actor and frontend forms. Added English language support and i18n infrastructure (SPEC_EN.md, i18n provider, translations) along with UI refinements such as new icons, Tailwind configuration, and a redesigned login button. These changes expand functionality, improve usability, and unify the interface language.

GitHub Link: https://github.com/Satsurance/canisters/tree/feature/staking-layout
Total Score: 6/9
README Documentation: 3/5
Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a clear project description and fairly detailed setup instructions for local development, including Rust, DFX, wasm target installation, repository cloning, required Pocket‑IC binary setup, building, and testing. However, it lacks integration guidance (e.g., how to use the canister, API endpoints, or example interactions) and does not include any contribution guidelines such as code style, pull‑request process, or issue reporting. While the structure and formatting are good and the grammar is acceptable, the missing integration and contribution sections keep the documentation at a “fair” level rather than “good” or “excellent.”

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week we delivered several minor updates and fixes while also adding comprehensive tests for the reward functionality, boosting its test coverage and reliability. The new tests ensure the reward feature works as intended and help prevent future regressions. Overall, these improvements enhance system stability and confidence in the reward module.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week we merged the Sat‑UI component into the main repository, streamlined deposit and reward transfers into a single transaction, and fixed bugs in the deposit/withdraw flow and reward‑rate‑per‑share calculation. We introduced a TestClient helper, moved shared utilities into a common module, and refactored the test suite (including restoring an episode test and enhancing reward‑distribution tests). The changes consolidate the UI codebase, reduce fees, and markedly improve test reliability, maintainability, and overall code quality.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we introduced a new ICP plugin and the Sat‑UI component, updated core files (index.js, web3store.js) to integrate the plugin, and renamed the frontend and backend canisters for clearer organization while removing an obsolete deployment file. We also cleaned up the navigation bar (dropping “Learn More” and “Insurance” tabs), reverted the staking and faucet implementation to simplify the feature set, and performed general code clean‑up. Together these changes add fresh UI functionality, streamline the canister structure, and reduce complexity across the application.

PROJECT 12: sardariuss/dsonance
------------------------------------------------------------
GitHub Link: https://github.com/sardariuss/dsonance
Total Score: 4/9
README Documentation: 1/5
Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The provided text is not a README at all—it consists of a single informal question about a specific edge case. It contains none of the essential elements of good documentation: there is no project description, no setup or installation instructions for local development, no integration or usage guide, and no contribution guidelines. The text also lacks any clear structure, headings, formatting, or even basic grammatical polish expected in a README. Consequently, it offers virtually no value to a developer or contributor trying to understand or work with the project.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: The documentation was updated: a new illustration (image (8).png) was added and the tokenomics markdown was revised to show a reduced total supply (10 million DSN) with corrected allocation percentages for core builder seed, governance bootstrap, community treasury, vesting pool, and user mining rewards. These edits improve the accuracy of the project’s economic model presentation. No code or functional features were changed.; Week of 2025-09-08: Implemented extensive lending module refinements, including corrected fee calculations, new verifications in lending pool tests, and a revised borrow‑interest computation. Cleaned up obsolete components (shares, obs, clock) and shifted TVL updates to the VoteController, while improving UtilizationUpdater and participation‑mining sync logic. These changes enhance fee accuracy, streamline controller responsibilities, and boost overall protocol reliability.; Week of 2025-09-15: The borrow page received a minor UI overhaul and terminology updates (renaming “ballot” to “foresight” and “vote” to “market”). NFID authentication was integrated and a new wallet drawer component was added, alongside hook improvements (useCallback, ordering fixes) and a refresh fix for the vote list. Overall, these changes enhance user navigation, authentication flow, and UI consistency.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week the UI was updated to use the new “foresight” terminology and to display mined DSN balances, adding a withdraw button on the profile that calls the protocol’s withdraw_mined method and refreshes both the participation tracker and the user’s balance. Number formatting was refined by introducing a significant‑digits formatter in the fungible‑ledger hook and switching dashboard tables from compact to full‑format values. Together, these changes improve balance visibility, user feedback, and interaction with the participation tracker.

Total Score: 3/9
README Documentation: 2/5
Commit Activity: 0/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a good high‑level overview of the project (purpose, problem statement, feature list, tech stack) and is reasonably well‑formatted. However, it lacks essential developer‑focused documentation: there are no setup or installation instructions for running the project locally, no guide on how to configure Firebase, Gemini API, or Google Calendar integrations, and no information on how to build/run tests or start the development server. Additionally, there are no contribution guidelines, code of conduct, or instructions for adding new features. Because of these significant gaps, the documentation is limited and would not enable a new contributor or developer to get the project up and running without external guidance. Hence it rates as a 2 (Poor).

Commit Activity: 2/3
dfx.json Present: 1/1

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a solid project overview, including a clear description, problem/solution narrative, tech stack, and links to the live application and whitepaper. It also lists prerequisites for local development, which is helpful. However, the setup instructions are incomplete (the “Local Development” section is truncated after “Install Dependencies”), and there are no detailed step‑by‑step commands for building, deploying, or testing the canisters. Additionally, the document lacks an integration guide (e.g., how other projects could interact with the DAO or token contracts) and does not contain contribution guidelines such as coding standards, pull‑request process, or issue reporting. While the formatting and grammar are good, the missing sections prevent it from being a comprehensive developer guide, resulting in a fair (3) rating.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: The README was extensively rewritten to showcase the project’s first‑place hackathon win, add branding badges, detailed whitepaper, problem/solution overview, and tech‑stack information. No source code files were added, removed, or altered, so the functional features of the application remain unchanged. This update primarily improves documentation and project presentation.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented a full backend canister for campaign management, introducing persistent actor logic, data models (campaigns, donations, creators) and related functionality in src/backend/main.mo. Added deployment configuration for the Internet Computer (IC) network in dfx.json, a new canister_ids.json file, and updated the README with live URLs, deployment steps, and frontend install commands. These changes provide a functional backend service and documentation for deploying the application to the IC mainnet.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-22: This week we delivered a complete ICP payment verification system for name registration—including backend canister structures, ledger block queries, replay‑attack protection, CLI balance checks, UI payment status/history, dynamic ID labeling, and a simulated identity flow—while also streamlining the developer experience with generated canister declaration files in version control and a pre‑build script that auto‑generates them. We added a whitelist‑based admin registration, auto‑populated address fields from the connected ICP Identity, a redesigned “My Names” page, numerous UI refinements (direct‑to‑settings button, alternating home‑page backgrounds, disabled‑state tabs, tighter padding, updated season info and ICP price formatting), tighter TypeScript type safety, and removed the payment requirement from the registration form, plus cleaned up obsolete files. Combined with the initial backend/frontend scaffolding and Claude AI integration, these changes secure the registration flow, improve usability, and accelerate development and deployment.

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides a handful of useful elements—namely a list of deployed canisters and Solana program addresses, plus a brief “Getting Started” section that walks a developer through navigating to the `web_app` folder, installing npm dependencies, and launching the app locally. However, it lacks a clear, high‑level project description that explains what BIT10 does, its architecture, or its primary use‑cases. There is no integration guide for developers who might want to consume the canisters or Solana programs, nor are there contribution guidelines, coding standards, or a roadmap. The formatting is also a bit inconsistent (e.g., a truncated URL at the end of the “Access” step). While the basic setup steps are present, the documentation is missing several key elements that would make it fully usable for new contributors or integrators, placing it in the “Fair” range.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: The home page UI was refreshed, the server was enhanced with new rebalance logic, and a testnet canister was added to enable purchasing BIT10.

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides solid **setup instructions** for local development, including commands to start the replica, deploy canisters, generate Candid interfaces, and run the frontend server. It also notes environment‑variable considerations for production builds. However, it lacks a meaningful **project description**—readers are not told what the `primelendrow` project actually does or its purpose. There is no **integration guide** beyond the generic DFX commands, nor are there any **contribution guidelines** (e.g., how to submit pull requests, coding standards, testing procedures). The structure and formatting are clear and the grammar is fine, but the missing contextual and contribution information keeps the documentation at a basic, functional level rather than a comprehensive one. Hence, it merits a “fair” rating.

README Documentation Evaluation:
  The README provides the essential steps for getting the project running locally (DFX start, deploy, npm scripts) and includes a brief “Quick Start” style overview with useful links. It also outlines deployment to the Internet Computer and gives specific admin‑setup commands for the canister. However, the document lacks a substantive project description—there is no clear statement of what ckTon does, its architecture, or its intended use cases. Integration guidance is minimal (only a few canister‑call examples) and there are no instructions for how external developers might interact with the canister beyond those calls. There is also no contribution guide, code‑of‑conduct, or information on how to submit issues or pull requests. Grammar and formatting are generally acceptable, though occasional spacing issues (e.g., “set`DFX_NETWORK`”) and inconsistent capitalization detract slightly from readability. Overall, the README covers basic local‑development setup but misses several key documentation elements, warranting a fair rating of 3.

  3 - Commits every week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: Implemented fixes for routing issues and partially built the onboarding and doctors pages, enhancing navigation and introducing initial user onboarding functionality. These changes improve the app’s core flow and lay groundwork for further doctor‑related features.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week we delivered a new landing page layout with refined UI elements, fixed smart‑contract syntax errors, added initial calendar functionality, and enhanced responsiveness across key pages. We also completed the therapist UI and pages, introduced functional dashboards for doctors and patients, and refreshed onboarding data. Additionally, a Rust‑based secure messaging system with cryptographic protection was integrated, boosting interaction security across the platform.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we hardened platform security by migrating the security layer to smart contracts, encrypting PHI fields with key management, restricting MVT‑token canister access, adding UUID/session‑ID validation, and fixing Wasm validation errors, while also improving authentication handling, health‑checks, and rate‑limited signup flows. We refactored the backend into modular components, streamlined the frontend build to deploy directly to canisters, generated type declarations, and resolved numerous integration and import bugs, resulting in more reliable inter‑canister communication and faster releases. Finally, the landing page received visual updates and the user registration feature was completed and stabilized with response handling, phone‑number formatting, and proper backend initialization, delivering a polished UI and robust onboarding experience.; Week of 2025-09-22: We delivered a new admin frontend that communicates with canisters via embedded JavaScript and completed the MVT token staking feature, now ready for mainnet deployment. The BackendService API was enhanced so `getUserStake` can return null, claim‑and‑stake logic was fixed on mainnet, and the UI received a refreshed design along with a new build and generation process. Minor updates and bug fixes were applied across the codebase.

  The README fragment provides visually appealing mermaid diagrams that highlight the project's key innovations (Instruction‑to‑Agent workflow, NOVAQ compression, and on‑chain architecture). However, it lacks essential documentation elements:

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-15: This week the team added the OHMS Agent canister with comprehensive type definitions and methods for agent configuration, inference, and task management, introduced a shared‑types package that unifies interfaces across Model Repository, Agent, Coordinator, and Economics services, and initialized the OHMS 2.0 monorepo with build, deployment, and setup scripts while refactoring the communication layer and removing obsolete modules (InferenceService, InstructionAnalyzer, MemoryService). They also merged the core OHMS components—website, UI, model, econ, and coordinator—into the main codebase, consolidating subsystems for upcoming releases. Minor updates and fixes were applied throughout to improve stability and consistency.

Commit Activity Evaluation:
  2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week introduced a governance committee module, added full token management—including creation, Ethereum‑compatible token handling, and a new transfer API endpoint—and refined nonce handling with a fix to increment_nonce. Existing token and governance components were further integrated and stabilized across the codebase. Together, these updates expand core token operations, enable Ethereum token support, and improve overall system reliability.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we launched a full debate‑simulation flow and added comprehensive committee support—including creation, assignment, suggestion UI, and related backend structures—while also delivering a new multi‑tab DAO dashboard (Overview, Members, Proposals, Distribution, Treasury, Governance, Canister) with live data, interactive charts, and multi‑chain wallet balances (ICP, BTC, ETH, USDT). Backend improvements introduced exponential‑backoff retry logic, expanded chain handling (EthLocal, EthSepolia, nonce utilities), a local ICP ledger, ICRC token transfers, configurable factory canister defaults, and streamlined deployment scripts for local environments. Together these changes dramatically enhance proposal workflows, governance visibility, and cross‑chain operations for both developers and users.
