Performance and build stability were boosted by upgrading to Next 15.4.7, disabling ESLint during compilation, memoising search hooks, AI/prompt handlers, and data‑fetching callbacks, and fixing middleware redirects and UI import issues. Together these changes tighten security, improve responsiveness, and raise overall code quality and developer experience.; Week of 2025-09-15: Added a suite of new backend capabilities—including collaborators and hashed API‑key modules, subscription plan enforcement, full revision and diff tracking for notes, a versioned AI‑generation endpoint with provider‑agnostic routing, and a complete account‑deletion and passkey‑auth flow—alongside extensive schema updates, tag‑management deduplication/hydration, and a robust cursor‑based pagination system with configurable page sizes. Existing features were refined with sharing‑UI enhancements, optimistic updates, AI‑button health checks, global keyboard shortcuts, and idempotent guards that prevent duplicate entries, plus performance‑focused changes such as reduced userId size and dual‑write synchronization.
