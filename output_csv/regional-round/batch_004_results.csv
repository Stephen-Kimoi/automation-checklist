The setup steps are incomplete (e.g., an unclosed code block, missing instructions for configuring the Internet Computer SDK, and no guidance on running the services). There is no clear project description that explains the purpose, target audience, or high‑level functionality beyond the feature list. Integration or usage instructions (how to use the resume builder, API endpoints, etc.) are absent, and there are no contribution guidelines, code of conduct, or instructions for submitting issues/pull requests. Formatting and grammar also need improvement (broken markdown, stray characters, inconsistent capitalization). Because of these substantial gaps, the documentation rates as **Poor (2)**.","2 - commits for two weeks. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: Implemented optimistic certification creation by adding a local ID (`lid`) and updating the Certification service to return structured responses, with matching changes in the frontend handler, store (including a new `lid` field and `areHandlersReady` helper) and UI components. Added a `areHandlersReady` check to ensure all resume handlers are initialized before fetching data, refined the AuthProvider’s network handling, and introduced `isBackendId` guards to disable delete actions for unsaved items. These updates improve reliability of data operations, loading‑state handling, and overall user experience.; Week of 2025-09-08: Added a new assessment feature, introducing functionality for creating and managing assessments within the application.
