Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week added full token‑transfer support to the dashboard, including a new TokenTransferModal component, UI buttons for sending/receiving/history, and corresponding ledger canister entries (ICP and ckETH) in dfx.json. Backend canisters now expose deleteAgent and deleteTool functions, while the frontend received agent‑deletion UI, updated hooks (including a useUserDeleteAgent mutation), a loading fallback component, and numerous UI refinements (renamed routes, improved cards, badge styling, and service file renames). Together these changes expand financial interactions, give users the ability to remove agents/tools, and improve overall responsiveness and consistency of the Neuroverse Studio app.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week introduced a full document‑management backend (new Motoko types for files, vetkeys, and NFTs plus file upload/download services) and corresponding frontend services, UI components, and type definitions to handle uploading, downloading, and whitelist management. The UI was refreshed across the layout, index page, and auth button (added footer, responsive headings, redesigned hero section, and improved token‑transfer modals) and integrated ICP ledger transfers via a new `IcpLedgerCanister` utility with mutation hooks. Dependency updates added the `@dfinity/vetkeys` package and optimized the backend canister for cycles.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we added token‑transfer functionality—including an account‑to‑account transfer hook and refined token‑formatting utilities—while enhancing agent creation with a reset function, tool selection, and tighter payment‑modal integration featuring better error handling, UI tweaks, and SEO‑focused meta‑tag updates. We also introduced the Aurora component, a customizable dynamic gradient background with adjustable color stops, amplitude, and blend properties, which was applied to the CallToAction section and the Index page along with new CSS utilities for gradient text and backgrounds. Together, these changes improve core payment workflows, streamline agent tooling, and significantly boost the site’s visual design and interactivity.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week a new HeroSection (with an Orb UI component) was added to the front‑end and the main page was refactored to use it, while the token‑transfer modal and query keys were updated for consistency. Authentication and token handling were overhauled: the code now uses `IcrcLedgerCanister` with dynamic identity/host creation, adds dev‑mode safeguards for Plug and NFID, and updates host URLs and the identity provider URL. Overall, these changes refresh the UI, tighten security, and streamline ledger interactions across the app.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure

Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: The week focused on replacing the Web3Auth and biometric verification stack with a streamlined NFID‑based authentication system: a new NFID_AUTH_GUIDE.md was added, AuthButton and related UI components were refactored to use SimpleAuthContext, and all Web3Auth, biometric services, and related pages were removed. Additional UI improvements include new lazy‑loaded AI and chart components, migration from Next.js links to react‑router‑dom, and Vite chunk‑splitting optimizations. These changes simplify the login flow, reduce dependencies, and prepare the app for lighter, more maintainable front‑end performance.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented functional authentication and added Metamask-based login, enhancing the app’s user authentication capabilities.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week added backend support for NGOs and carbon‑offset claims (new NGOProfile and Claim structs) and introduced a suite of new frontend pages—Submit Project, Projects Listing, Project Details, an enhanced Marketplace, and an Admin‑panel placeholder—along with routing updates and UI components such as ClaimSubmissionForm, ProfileDropdown, and PostLoginRegistrationModal. The Header and LoginButton were refactored to display a profile dropdown for authenticated users, and the project‑submission flow was expanded with tree‑specific fields and per‑user local‑storage persistence.
