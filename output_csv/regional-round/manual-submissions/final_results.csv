toonshi/mshamba,https://github.com/toonshi/mshamba,2,1,1,4,"The README provides a handful of operational commands (e.g., `dfx deploy`, `npm run generate`, `npm start`, and several `dfx canister call` examples) which give a basic sense of how to run the project locally and how to test specific canisters. However, it lacks a clear project overview or purpose, any high‑level architecture description, and does not explain what the scripts or canisters actually do. There are no contribution guidelines, no instructions for installing prerequisites (e.g., DFX, Node.js), and the “TO:DO” note is left in the documentation, indicating incomplete guidance. Formatting is uneven (missing code fences in places) and the flow is fragmented, making it hard for a new developer to understand the overall workflow. Because of these significant gaps, the documentation falls short of a “fair” rating and is best described as poor.","1 - commits for only one week.
