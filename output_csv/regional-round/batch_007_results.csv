Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week added a new “Factoria” factory canister (including its source file, deployment config, ID entry, optimize‑size flag and test scripts) to enable scalable creation and reuse of child Reputation DAO canisters. The Reputation DAO code was refactored into a streamlined child canister (with updated hashing, argument encoding, and safety‑rail logic) and its build settings were adjusted for size optimization. Minor UI tweaks (updated Hero video link) and assorted test scripts were also introduced.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we integrated a modern Tailwind UI from the newUI branch, replacing the old frontend while preserving the existing backend and canister architecture, and cleaned up duplicate files, corrected import paths, and updated tsconfig and dependencies to resolve merge conflicts and ensure a clean, error‑free build. Minor updates and fixes were also applied across the codebase. The result is a refreshed, more maintainable user interface and a more stable overall application.; Week of 2025-09-22: This week’s nine commits delivered a series of minor updates and bug fixes, refining existing functionality and enhancing overall stability.

Updated the Internet Identity candid interface to support generic OpenID configurations and added corresponding feature flags. Adjusted the NFTPets panel, service‑worker revision, and Vite env handling to align with the new functionality.; Week of 2025-09-08: Added a new Medical History and Vaccines feature, allowing users to record and view past medical information and vaccination records.
