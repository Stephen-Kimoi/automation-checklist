Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-01: This week we standardized the transferToken response format, added comprehensive try‑catch error handling, and updated the wallet provider to correctly process success/error responses and refresh balances after transfers. We migrated the deployment to a new factory‑managed canister, rebuilt the SDK with an optimized bundle and refreshed configurations, and verified full multi‑chain token support while refining the ICRC vs. SPL transfer flow (including direct ICRC transfers and Solana RPC signing). These improvements resolve transfer errors and “Product token not supported” issues, boosting reliability, error visibility, and readiness for cross‑chain token operations.; Week of 2025-09-08: This week added full Solana support: new utility modules (`solanaUtils.js`, `useSolanaCanister.jsx`) and extensive backend canister extensions (Rust types, storage, HTTP outcalls, multi‑chain data structures) enable SOL and SPL token balances, transactions, and analytics. The UI was upgraded with a richer `TokenIcon` (logo caching, timeout handling) and a multi‑chain `TokenSelector` that lets users filter between ICP and Solana tokens, plus new CSS styling for chain badges. Configuration was updated to point to a working user‑payment canister and the provider hook now fetches and merges ICP and SPL tokens, improving error handling and logging.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week we added comprehensive multi‑chain support—including wallet creation, address and gas‑price queries, ERC20 and token‑configuration types, network‑configuration structs, a full HTTP RPC layer with rate limiting, caching, JSON‑RPC types, and a dashboard component for real‑time ETH, ERC20 and Solana balance queries—while expanding the Candid interface and integrating EVM metrics, transaction validation, and status handling. We also introduced robust error handling, specific EVM error types, replay‑protected transaction signing, a full testing suite, optimized canister builds, deployment scripts, NPM bundles, source maps, and refactored the SDK to use a factory‑deployed canister with improved bundle loading and caching of token data.
