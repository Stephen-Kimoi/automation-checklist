MrAech/InheritNext,https://github.com/MrAech/InheritNext,3,1,1,5,"The README provides a solid project overview, feature list, architecture diagram, tech stack, and a clear directory layout, which gives readers a good high‑level understanding of the system. However, it lacks essential practical details: there are no setup or installation instructions for getting the frontend and Rust canister running locally, no steps for building/deploying the canister, no guidance on how to integrate the API with other services, and no contribution guidelines (e.g., code style, pull‑request process, testing). While the existing sections are well‑structured and grammatically sound, the missing setup and contribution information prevents it from being a complete developer guide, placing it at a “Fair” (3) rating.","1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-22: This week introduced a suite of new UI pages—including Approvals, Dashboard (asset/heir management), HeirView, Sign‑In, Terms & Plan, and Vaults for registering NFTs—alongside backend enhancements such as an authenticated actor wrapper, PBKDF2/SHA‑256 hashing utilities, and toast notifications with improved state handling. Code quality and performance were also refined via CSS cleanup, a utility refactor, import‑style fixes, and an optimized Vite configuration for better chunking. Overall, the updates expand core functionality, strengthen security, and improve developer and user experience.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure

However, it lacks essential documentation elements:","1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-22: This week we added a refined liquidity‑pool data model and an enhanced query API to the backend aggregator for faster pool data retrieval, while also revamping the OpenID registration workflow to improve data handling and integration. We cleaned up core codebases—refactoring the aggregator, frontend configuration, and authentication hook—to boost readability, maintainability, and stability, and expanded rustc_info.json with new compiler output fields for richer tooling metadata. Documentation was also updated with a business model, traction metrics, and roadmap, giving clearer project direction.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure

amososwom/pulse,https://github.com/amososwom/pulse,1,2,1,4,"The provided README fragment contains only a brief invitation to contributors and a license notice. It lacks a clear project description, any setup or local development instructions, integration or usage guides, and detailed contribution guidelines. There is no structure, headings, or explanatory content that would help a new user understand or work with the project. Consequently, the documentation is minimal and does not meet any of the criteria for higher scores.","2 - Commits every other week. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: This week we refined the role‑registry canister, improving its functionality and reliability, while also delivering a series of minor updates and bug fixes across the codebase. These changes enhance role management, tighten overall system stability, and streamline future development.; Week of 2025-09-15: This week introduced a new combined backend canister (PulseMarket) that implements a multi‑token ledger with metadata, approvals, and a simple marketplace MVP, and the project was switched to use Mops for packaging (added mops.toml and updated dfx.json packtool). The frontend was updated to render the main <App/> component, added a “whoami” UI with styling tweaks, and the Internet Identity canister configuration was refined (init args, remote ID, and wasm URL). Documentation and assets were also refreshed (new banner, README rewrite) and supporting files (.gitignore, dfx copy.json) were added.; Week of 2025-09-22: Implemented a creator token system, adding both backend token generation and a corresponding UI form. Integrated the landing page with the login flow for a unified entry experience. Updated authentication logic and refined token handling across the backend.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure
