amososwom/pulse,https://github.com/amososwom/pulse,1,2,1,4,"The provided README excerpt contains only a brief, incomplete sentence inviting contributors and a license notice. It lacks a clear project description, any setup or installation instructions for local development, integration or usage guidance, and detailed contribution guidelines. There is also no structure, headings, or formatting beyond the license header, making it difficult to understand the project's purpose or how to get started. Consequently, the documentation is minimal and does not meet any of the key criteria for a usable README.","2 - commits for two weeks. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-09-08: Implemented a series of minor updates and bug fixes that refined existing functionality, enhancing stability and performance across the platform.; Week of 2025-09-15: Implemented a new combined Motoko canister that merges a multi‑token ledger with a marketplace (including token creation, metadata, approvals, and buy‑flow logic) and added MOPS packaging support via updated dfx.json, .mops ignore entry, mops.toml, and a copy.json helper. The frontend was switched to render the main App component, UI styling and the Internet Identity provider URL were refined, and the project README and assets were refreshed. These changes introduce core token‑and‑marketplace functionality, improve build tooling, and polish the user interface and documentation.; Week of 2025-09-22: Implemented a creator token generation system, adding a backend token creation routine and a corresponding UI form. Consolidated the landing page with the login flow for a streamlined entry experience. Updated authentication handling to support the new token-based processes.",dfx.json file found - indicates ICP/Dfinity project structure
