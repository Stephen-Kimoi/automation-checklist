The instructions are well-organized and easy to follow. The dependencies are not explicitly listed, but it's clear that the project requires Rust, TypeScript, and Vite dependencies, which are mentioned in the file structure. The README also mentions prerequisites for the DFX Local Server and Internet Identity Canister.","The README file is generally well-structured and clear, with a good balance of concise explanations and technical details. The use of headers, bold text, and emojis helps to break up the content and make it more visually appealing. The organization is logical, with clear sections for the project's vision, key problems addressed, key features, and project structure.","The project has a decent number of commits (42) during the hackathon period, which indicates some level of development activity. The recent commit messages suggest that the team is working on frontend changes, UI progress, and prompts passing with API, which are all meaningful contributions to the project. While there are some merge pull requests, they are not the only type of commit, which indicates that the team is actively developing the project. However, the commit messages could be more descriptive and provide more context about the changes made, which would improve the overall quality of the commit history. Overall, the project shows good development activity during the hackathon period, but could benefit from more detailed commit messages."

The instructions are clear, but the process is not broken down into smaller, manageable steps. Additionally, the installation of dfx is not fully explained, and the user is referred to an external link. It would be beneficial to include more context or a brief explanation of what dfx is and why it's necessary. Overall, the README provides a good foundation for installation, but some improvements could be made to make it more user-friendly and detailed.","The README file is generally clear and well-structured, with a good flow of information. The team introduction and motivation/problem statement sections effectively set the context for the project. The technical details and instructions for running the project locally are also well-organized and easy to follow.","The project has only 3 commits during the entire hackathon period, which is a very low activity. The commit messages are also very generic and repetitive, indicating that most of the commits are minor changes. There is no evidence of significant project development or meaningful changes during this period. The consistency of development activity is also poor, with only three commits scattered throughout the hackathon period. Overall, the commit activity is very poor, and the project should aim to increase its development activity to show actual progress."

However, the recent commit messages suggest that the development activity is not particularly consistent or meaningful. The messages consist of a mix of creating and deleting files, with only one commit mentioning adding files via upload.
