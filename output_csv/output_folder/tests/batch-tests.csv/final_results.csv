Overall, the documentation is good, but could benefit from some additional details and explicit guidance on contribution.","1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-08-01: This week, minor updates were made to the README.md file, primarily focusing on updating the project's tagline, target market, and functional components. Additionally, two files were modified: authWithNFID.js and authWithII.js, with each change adding a single line to disclose that the content will not be disclosed but will be disclosed soon. These updates appear to be focused on refining the project's documentation and identity verification processes."
JonathanMaverick/DContest,https://github.com/JonathanMaverick/DContest,3,0,3,"The README file is decent, but it lacks a clear and comprehensive project description. While it provides some setup instructions for local development, it is limited to running the project on Windows and does not provide a general guide for other operating systems. The integration guide is also missing, and the contribution guidelines are not explicitly stated. The file is well-structured, and the formatting is good, but it could be improved by providing more detailed information about the project and its components. Additionally, the inclusion of external links (e.g., project summary and demo) is helpful, but it would be better to include more information within the README file itself.",No commits found during hackathon period.. No weekly development activity to summarize.
FathanAkram-app/BitSub,https://github.com/FathanAkram-app/BitSub,4,1,5,"The README file provides a good overview of the project, including its description, features, and technical details. The file is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear headings and minimal typos. However, it falls short in providing setup instructions for local development and contribution guidelines. The setup instructions are limited to a one-command script, and there is no guidance on how to set up the project on a local machine. Additionally, there is no clear information on how to contribute to the project, such as how to submit pull requests, create issues, or participate in discussions. Nonetheless, the file is overall well-organized and provides a good starting point for a new contributor to get started with the project.","1 - 1 or 2 commits. Weekly development summary: Week of 2025-08-15: This week, the development team made UI enhancements, cleaned up the architecture, and fixed some bugs, resulting in an improved overall user experience."
